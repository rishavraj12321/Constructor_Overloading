# Constructor_Overloading
Create a class named 'Box' with three data members- length, breadth and height and a
method to calculate the volume which is 
volume = length * breadth * height .
The class has three
constructors which are :
1 - Having no parameter - values of both length, breadth and height are assigned zero.
2 - Having three numbers as parameters - the three numbers are assigned as length,
breadth and height respectively.
3 - Having one number as parameter - all length, breadth and height are assigned that
number.
Now, create objects of the 'Box' class having none, one and three parameters and print
their volume.
